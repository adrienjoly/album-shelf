# album-shelf

`album-shelf` is a static web page to display and explore my collection of music records.

It uses Jekyll to render the list in HTML from a YAML data file (see [`albums.yaml`](./_data/albums.yaml)) and Github-pages to make it accessible to the public.

If you want to have a similar page for your own album collection, feel free to fork this repository and replace my list of albums by yours!

## Features

### Add album from Spotify

```
$ npm run add:spotify-album >>_data/albums.yaml
```

### Extract albums from user's playlists on Spotify

```
$ npm run export:spotify-playlists >>_data/albums.yaml
```
